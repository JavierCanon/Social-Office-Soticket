# Principles

### Reasons Why Ticket Tracking Software is Better than Email

#### 1. Everything is centralized in one place

“When there are a lot of people working on requests, it keeps tracking of information far easier. Instead of remembering to CC someone on that email stream so that they know the history, bam. It’s right there in the ticket for that issue.”

“If you have a lot of requests or tasks to complete, and have to put something off for a few days to put out a fire or ten, it’s nice to be able to open a ticket and see all the relevant info right away instead of digging through emails.”

“I think that ticket tracking system’s major benefit to me is that it functions as a “System of Record”. As a project progresses, all the key information ends up being documented in the ticket tracking system, so that at any time later ( years, for instance ) it’s not a question of “Whose email is it in?” but “let me look in our ticket tracking application…”

#### 2. Provides built in tracking and reporting metrics

“It is easier to determine whether someone is working efficiently since you are tracking information.”

“You can track things easier, for example, you can run a report on every ticket a teammate has worked on in the past month.”

#### 3. Helps prioritize workflow

“It also allows you to more easily prioritize workflow. At one job, we had 1-5 to number priorities, where 1 was ‘Holy [heck] whole network is down’ and 5 was “So-and-so needs us to come re-route cabling in their desk to improve the feng shui.”

“You can apply a custom work flow to issue resolution.”


#### 4. Adds transparency

“A ticket tracking system is better for determining which departments/teams/businesses are receiving the most support requests so you can allocate your support resources efficiently.”

“Even if you don’t expose it to your end-users, and just have them send emails into a support address a ticket system that will significantly increase accountability, provide a baseline, and ensure issues don’t fall through the cracks as easily.”

“Supervisors can see at a glance what needs to be done, what’s the status of the various issues, and who worked on them.”


#### 5. Fosters collaboration

“I don’t like sharing my email inbox with others but everyone can view and edit tickets in a ticket tracking system…”

“If you’re a one-man department, you can optimize the [heck] out of e-mail for your own personal use. However, as soon as you add a second person to your team, interpersonal communication means you have to find a better ticket tracking tool for collaboration.”

“Multiple people can work on the same issue, and in doing so can keep their progress in the same place.”

#### 6. Ensures continuity

“It’s easier to deal with reorganizing issues if a team member leaves, since you can just look through all the ones still assigned to them, and reassign as necessary.”

Simply put: if you need to delegate tasks to others and track those tasks closely, ticket tracking is superior to email. That’s why it’s perfect for people who start their own businesses. Ticket tracking systems are also a good fit for people who work in a position where they they manage others or handle support requests.
